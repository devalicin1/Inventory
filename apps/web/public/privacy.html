    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
      information when you use the Inventory web application and related
      services (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to
      the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information</strong>: Name, email address, company name,
        and other details you provide when creating an account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage data</strong>: Log data, device information, IP address,
        and interaction data about how you use the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business data</strong>: Inventory items, transactions, and other
        records you store in the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third‑party integrations</strong>: Data imported from connected
        services (e.g. QuickBooks Online), in accordance with your
        authorizations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
      <li>Process inventory and related business operations.</li>
      <li>Improve and optimize performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. QuickBooks &amp; Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      When you connect your QuickBooks Online account, we access your
      QuickBooks data via secure APIs using OAuth tokens that you authorize.
      Inventory sync from QuickBooks is <strong>read‑only</strong>: we do not modify or
      write data back to QuickBooks. We only access the data necessary to
      perform the integrations you enable.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with trusted
      service providers that help us operate the Service (e.g. hosting, error
      monitoring, analytics), under appropriate data protection agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
      your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no
      method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot
      guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to
      provide the Service and comply with legal obligations. You may request
      deletion of your account data by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data.</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain processing activities.</li>
      <li>Request a copy of your data in a portable format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your information may be processed and stored on servers located in
      countries outside your own. We take steps to ensure that such transfers
      comply with applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
      changes, we will notify you (for example, by email or in‑app
      notifications). Your continued use of the Service after changes become
      effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
