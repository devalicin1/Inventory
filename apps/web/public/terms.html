    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
      Inventory web application and related services (collectively, the
      "Service"). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you
      agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Account &amp; Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old and have the authority to enter into
      these Terms on behalf of yourself or your organization. You are
      responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
      credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use the Service only for lawful business purposes and in
      compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You must not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any illegal, fraudulent, or harmful activity.</li>
      <li>
        Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or related systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of
        the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data &amp; Integrations</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may integrate with third‑party platforms such as QuickBooks
      Online. When you connect a third‑party account, you authorize us to
      access and process data from that service on your behalf. We do not
      modify your QuickBooks data; inventory synchronization from QuickBooks to
      Inventory is read‑only and does not write changes back to QuickBooks.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Fees &amp; Payment</h2>
    <p>
      If you purchase a paid subscription, you agree to pay the applicable
      fees, taxes, and charges. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are
      non‑refundable. We may change pricing or plans with prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all
      software, designs, logos, and content (excluding your own data), are
      owned by us or our licensors. You receive a limited, non‑exclusive,
      non‑transferable license to use the Service in accordance with these
      Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without
      warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant
      that the Service will be uninterrupted, error‑free, or meet your specific
      requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any
      indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or any
      loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, arising out of or
      related to your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate
      your access if you violate these Terms or if we believe it is necessary
      to protect the Service, other users, or comply with legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes,
      we will provide notice (for example, by email or in‑app notification).
      Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective
      constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>
